**What exactly is the AGL Wind Farms Dataset?**

-   Read the [AGL Wind Farms Dataset
    Description](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/github/academic-hub/datasets/blob/master/Wind_Farms_Dataset_Doc.ipynb)
    document

    -   Describes the assets and challenges involved, along with
        data streams, meta data, and overall shape

    -   Explains the data views, and which ones are available for
        the dataset

**If this dataset seems aligned to your interests:**

-   Read through the [Hub Python Library QuickStart Guide Preview
    Version](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/github/academic-hub/datasets/blob/master/Hub_Library_Quickstart.ipynb)

**Teacher’s Assistant (TA) Guidebook**

-   The [TA
    Guidebook](https://academichub.blob.core.windows.net/hub/OSIsoft%20Academic%20Hub%20-%20TA%20Guidebook%20-%20General%20Distribution.pdf)
    contains step by step instructions for a TA setting up a course to
    use the Academic Hub, including sections for:

    -   Software and Security Requirements

    -   Classroom Administration

    -   Academic Hub Account Creation Workflow

    -   Data Access Examples for Community Datasets

    -   Guidance for Contributing Datasets to the Academic Hub

**Exercise Example**

We created an example of an activity based on the AGL Wind Farms dataset.
Starting from 2 months of historical data, a prediction model of the active power of an entire cluster of wind turbines has been built, based on the Decision Tree Regression Machine Learning model.

Here you can find the Jupyter Notebook of this exercise: [AGL Wind Farm Power Prediction Notebook](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/github/academic-hub/datasets/blob/master/WIP/Wind_Farm_Academic_Hub.ipynb).

## Jupyter Notebook Download

-   If you already have Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda3) installed on your machine,
    you can download and run the Hub Python Library QuickStart Guide after you
    have created an OSIsoft Academic Hub Account

    1.  Create an OSIsoft Academic Hub (OSIsoft Cloud Services) Account using
        the [Account Registration](https://academic.osisoft.com/individual)

        -   OSIsoft will send an email to you acknowledging OSIsoft Cloud
            Services Account creation

            -   *OSIsoft Cloud Services Account creation process is not
                automated nor instant, due to required verification*

                -   The email will come from cloudservices\@osisoft.com

                -   You need to click on the acceptance link, boxed in red below

                -   Please note – every invitation expires after 21 days!

    2. **NOTE: the Quick Start notebook below requires an active Academic Hub account to connect to OCS.** But even before your account is active, it's a good way to test that your Anaconda Jupyter installation works OK and to install some required libraries needed by all Hub notebooks.

    3. Click on the download version of the [Hub Python Library QuickStart
        Guide Jupyter Download
        Version](https://academichub.blob.core.windows.net/hub/Hub_Library_Quickstart.ipynb) to save a copy of this notebook on your laptop.

    3.  Open up the Jupyter Notebook application in your browser by launching Anaconda Navigator installed in your laptop Start Menu for PCs (Application for Macs) and then clicking "Launch":
    ![](https://academichub.blob.core.windows.net/hub/media/anaconda-jupyter-launch.png)

    4.  In the newly opened browser tab at <http://localhost:8888/tree>, click on the "Downloads" folder (or wherever your default Downloads are stored)

    5.  Click on the “Hub_Library_Quickstart.ipynb” Jupyter Notebook, which
        will open up in a new browser tab

    6.  You are now able to click through and run the various Python code
        cells demonstrating how to navigate through the Deschutes Brewery
        Dataset.
