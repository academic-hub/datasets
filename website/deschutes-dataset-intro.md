## **What exactly is the Deschutes Dataset?**

-   Read the [Deschutes Dataset
    Description](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/github/academic-hub/datasets/blob/master/Brewery_Dataset_Doc.ipynb)
    document

    -   Describes the assets and processes Deschutes uses, along with data
        streams, meta data, and overall shape

    -   Explains the data views, and which ones are available for Deschutes
        Dataset

## **If the Deschutes Dataset seems aligned to your interests,**

-   Read through the [Hub Python Library QuickStart Guide Preview
    Version](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/github/academic-hub/datasets/blob/master/Hub_Library_Quickstart.ipynb)

## **Teacher’s Assistant (TA) Guidebook**

-   The [TA
    Guidebook](https://academichub.blob.core.windows.net/hub/OSIsoft%20Academic%20Hub%20-%20TA%20Guidebook%20-%20General%20Distribution.pdf)
    contains step by step instructions for a TA setting up a course to use the
    Academic Hub, including sections for:

    -   Software and Security Requirements

    -   Classroom Administration

    -   Academic Hub Account Creation Workflow

    -   Data Access Examples for Community Datasets

    -   Guidance for Contributing Datasets to the Academic Hub

### **We created curriculum based on the Deschutes Dataset, as a Jupyter Notebookwith three exercises**

-   [Exercise 1: Apparent Degree of
    Fermentation](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/url/localhost:8000/DESCHUTES_GUIDE.ipynb#exercise1)

    In this learning module, students analyze the Apparent Degree of
    Fermentation (ADF) during the beer-making process, which is a critical
    process parameter that informs brewers how much a batch has fermented over
    time. Through this exercise, students will learn how to build predictive
    linear and predictive piecewise linear models on ADF.

-   [Exercise 2: Beer Cooling
    Prediction](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/url/localhost:8000/DESCHUTES_GUIDE.ipynb#exercise2)

    In this learning module, students visualize and analyze the data, and build
    the predictive model of the cooling temperature. Consistent cooling
    temperature profile of every batch is directly related to the quality of
    beer production.

-   [Exercise 3: Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA)](https://data.academic.osisoft.com/nbviewer/url/localhost:8000/DESCHUTES_GUIDE.ipynb#exercise3)

    In the learning module, students use PCA to determine the anomalous
    production batch, and the contributing factors for such deviation behavior.
    Principal Component Analysis is a statistical technique that compresses the
    dimensionality of large datasets to a few Principal Components to represent
    the data.

## Jupyter Notebook Download

-   If you already have Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda3) installed on your machine,
    you can download and run the Hub Python Library QuickStart Guide after you
    have created an OSIsoft Academic Hub Account

    1.  Create an OSIsoft Academic Hub (OSIsoft Cloud Services) Account using
        the [Account Registration](https://academic.osisoft.com/individual)

        -   OSIsoft will send an email to you acknowledging OSIsoft Cloud
            Services Account creation

            -   *OSIsoft Cloud Services Account creation process is not
                automated nor instant, due to required verification*

                -   The email will come from cloudservices\@osisoft.com

                -   You need to click on the acceptance link, boxed in red below

                -   Please note – every invitation expires after 21 days!

    2. **NOTE: the Quick Start notebook below requires an active Academic Hub account to connect to OCS.** But even before your account is active, it's a good way to test that your Anaconda Jupyter installation works OK and to install some required libraries needed by all Hub notebooks. 

    3. Click on the download version of the [Hub Python Library QuickStart
        Guide Jupyter Download
        Version](https://academichub.blob.core.windows.net/hub/Hub_Library_Quickstart.ipynb) to save a copy of this notebook on your laptop. 

    3.  Open up the Jupyter Notebook application in your browser by launching Anaconda Navigator installed in your laptop Start Menu for PCs (Application for Macs) and then clicking "Launch": 
    ![](https://academichub.blob.core.windows.net/hub/media/anaconda-jupyter-launch.png)

    4.  In the newly opened browser tab at <http://localhost:8888/tree>, click on the "Downloads" folder (or wherever your default Downloads are stored)

    5.  Click on the “Hub_Library_Quickstart.ipynb” Jupyter Notebook, which
        will open up in a new browser tab

    6.  You are now able to click through and run the various Python code
        cells demonstrating how to navigate through the Deschutes Brewery
        Dataset.
