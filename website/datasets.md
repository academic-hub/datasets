In summary this dataset has:<br><ul><li>39 fermenter vessels with status information and up to 3 temperature control zones</li><li>13 bright tanks</li><li>Data from January 2017 up to May 2020</li></ul> <h4>**Exercise and Solution Notebooks for Brewery Dataset**</h4> <ul><li> **Exercise 1 - Apparent Degree of Fermentation learning objectives:** <br> Students will analyze the Apparent Degree of Fermentation (ADF) during the beer-making process, which is a critical process parameter that inform brewers how much a batch has fermented over time. Brewers use this parameter to make a shift from fermentation phase to free rise phase. Through this exercise, students will learn how to build the predictive linear, and predictive piecewise linear model on ADF.</li><li> **Exercise 2 - Beer Cooling Prediction learning objectives:** <br> Consistent cooling temperature profile of every batch is directly related to the quality of beer production. During the cooling phase of the brewing process, the temperature of the solution in the fermenter drops from 70°F to 30°F. In the learning module of Beer Cooling Prediction, students will visualize and analyze the data, and will build the predictive model of the cooling temperature.</li><li> **Exercise 3: Principal Component Analysis learning objectives:** <br> Principal Component Analysis is a statistical technique that compresses the dimensionality of large datasets to a few Principal Components to represent the data. In the learning module, students use PCA to determine the anomalous production batch, and the contributing factors for such deviation behavior.</li></ul> |
